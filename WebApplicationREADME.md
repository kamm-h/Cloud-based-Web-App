# Building, Securing, and Protecting a Web Application
I used Microsoft Azure and Docker to build and host my own cyber-blog web application.

The blog posts I included are discussing topics I feel should be considered by any organizations interested in cloud solutions.

I secured my application by creating and storing SSL certificates in Azure's Key Vault, and bound them to secure the web app.

Finally, I protected my web application by configuring Azure's Security features, such as Azure's Security Center.

All Azure technologies used: Docker, HTML, WAF, Key Vaults, Front Door, OpenSSL, App Services, PHP
